End-to-End Cricket Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project is an end-to-end data analysis of cricket match data, designed to uncover insights into player and team performance. Using Python and SQL, the project involves data collection, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization to identify trends such as top-performing players, match outcomes, and statistical patterns. The goal is to demonstrate proficiency in data analysis, data wrangling, and visualization for sports analytics.
Features

Data Collection: Sourced cricket match datasets (e.g., player stats, match results) from public repositories or APIs.
Data Cleaning: Handled missing values, inconsistent formats, and outliers using Pandas.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyzed metrics like batting averages, strike rates, and team win rates using SQL queries and Python.
Visualization: Created insightful plots (e.g., bar charts, heatmaps) using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Reporting: Generated a comprehensive report summarizing key findings, such as top performers and match trends.

Technologies Used

Python: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
SQL: For querying and aggregating data
Jupyter Notebook: For interactive analysis and visualization
Git: Version control for project management

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/Adi8Bharti/cricket-data-analysis.git
cd cricket-data-analysis


Set Up a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended):
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate


Install Dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


Download Dataset:

Place the dataset (e.g., cricket_data.csv) in the data/ folder.
Example datasets can be sourced from Kaggle or Cricsheet.


Run the Analysis:

Open analysis.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook:jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb


Alternatively, run the main script:python src/main.py

Usage

Data Preparation: Ensure the dataset is in the data/ folder. Update file paths in src/main.py or notebooks/analysis.ipynb if needed.
Run Analysis: Execute notebooks/analysis.ipynb for step-by-step analysis or src/main.py for automated processing.
View Results: Check the visualizations/ folder for generated plots (e.g., top batsmen, team performance trends).

Example Insights

Top 5 batsmen by average runs in the dataset.
Correlation between toss outcomes and match results.
Visualizations of team win percentages across seasons.
